									<h3> Our statement </h3>
									<p>
										Interdisciplinary Statement<br/>
Reaching out for help with obtaining food may seem like a foreign concept‚Ä¶ until it‚Äôs not.<br/>
Financial hardship is something that can occur to anyone without warning.<br/>
A lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck. (Lopez, 2025)<br/>
However, even those who are not cannot predict the future.<br/>
As a team, we have used our educational backgrounds and resources to collaborate and develop a plan for helping food banks become easier to access, and to help those who never thought they would need them, to reach out quickly to obtain the help needed.<br/>

As individuals, being able to meet our basic needs helps us function as a productive member of society.<br/>
One of those basic needs is being able to eat.<br/>
When that basic need cannot be met, you cannot function properly.<br/>
All focus moves to where your next meal will come from and how to feed your family; instead of focusing on other necessities to function as a normal human being.<br/>
Not having access to food will cause a crippling effect on society.<br/>

Through her knowledge of psychology, Andrea was able to understand the emotional changes that occur when individuals are in survival mode and was able to see what adaptations occur when a basic need is not being met.<br/>
She was able to use that knowledge to present ideas that would enable a website to not be demeaning.<br/>

Through her knowledge of the criminal justice system, Kailee was able to use her knowledge to know what issues tend to lead to food insecurity in society and was able to help shed light on what preventative measures could occur to stop food poverty.<br/>

Our goal with this project was to provide a streamlined approach that allowed individuals in need to food to find all information in one place.<br/>
A problem we found was that a lot of information is spread out and those who need it either don‚Äôt know where to find it or what questions to ask in order to get the help that they need.<br/>
Included in the website are a list of food banks and the contact information, general knowledge about healthy eating, problems that arise from food insecurity, etc.<br/>

In order to create the website, Najeeb‚Äôs computer skills were needed.<br/>
He created the website and incorporated the information that was necessary to create the convergence of information.<br/>
He was also able to present the information in an easy to access manner.<br/>

A stereotype that often occurs is that in order to use a food bank you need to ‚Äúlook‚Äù like you need the food that is offered.<br/>
In truth, that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. (McAulay 2021)<br/>
A lot of people fall on hard times and are just one paycheck or crisis away from serious financial downfall. (Lopez, 2025)<br/>

Without the convergence of Psychology, Criminal Justice and Computer Information Systems, we would not have been able to amply convey a streamlined solution directive.<br/>
